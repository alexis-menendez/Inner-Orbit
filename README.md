## **Description**

**InnerOrbit** is a full-stack, responsive, and interactive single-page application built using the MERN stack with GraphQL and JWT authentication. This application solves a real-world problem using real data and is designed with a smooth user experience and polished, professional UI in mind. 

**Problem Solved:** People struggle to understand emotional patterns and maintain consistent emotional routines. Traditional journals often lack visual feedback, encouragement, or the option to connect meaningfully with others without oversharing or losing privacy.

**Concept:** InnerOrbit is a social ritual app — a place where users occasionally share glimpses of their mood or thoughts into a public “galaxy” while still maintaining control, anonymity, and consent.

**App Overview**
* Mood Tracker: Calendar-based mood logging with color coding and editable daily entries.
* Mood Journal: Private journal visualized as constellations of stars, each representing an entry.
* Mood Nebulas: Optional public feed for anonymous, tagged reflections with light interaction.
* Constellation Cards: Weekly reflection prompts with the option to share responses anonymously.
* Orbits: Invite-only pods for sharing progress and encouragement with close friends.
* Self-Care Companion: Digital pet that reflects your real-world wellness habits.
* Privacy & Auth: Secure JWT authentication with private-first, consent-based sharing.
* Design & Deployment: Mobile-first calm UI, Tailwind CSS, and CI/CD deployment on Render.
