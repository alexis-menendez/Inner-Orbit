# InnerOrbit: *Mood Journal, Mood Tracker, & Reflective Social Space*

## **Description**

**InnerOrbit** is a full-stack wellness platform built with the MERN stack, GraphQL, and JWT authentication. It supports users in understanding and reflecting on their emotions through a set of visually rich, thoughtfully designed tools. With a mobile-first UI and consent-based privacy model, InnerOrbit balances personal introspection with optional social interaction in a calm, creative digital space.

**Concept:** is a reflective mental health app centered on visual rituals. Users map moods onto a tracker, write private journal entries visualized as constellations, and care for a virtual pet that responds to their emotional patterns. Optional sharing allows users to publish selected entries into a shared “galaxy,” offering glimpses into collective experience while preserving anonymity and consent.

**App Overview**
* Mood Tracker: Calendar-based mood logging with color coding and editable daily entries.
* Mood Journal: Private journal visualized as constellations of stars, each representing an entry.
* Pomodoro Timer: Simple, built-in timer to encourage focused productivity sessions and ability to customize the timer sound
* Library: Resource hub for videos, reflections, and guided exercises to support mental wellness and creative expression.
* Privacy & Auth: Secure JWT authentication with private-first, consent-based sharing.
* Design & Deployment: Mobile-first calm UI, Tailwind CSS, and CI/CD deployment on Render.
